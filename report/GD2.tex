\begin{abstract}

In this study we propose two variations on a game designed to improve player experience, and we use both AI agents and testing with human players to try to demonstrate that the game variants improve the players' experience. For the AI agents, a number of metrics are recorded from AI versus AI gameplay, and some simple analytics used to see if the intended impact is achieved. We then use human players to try to confirm these results, and to try to demonstrate the usefulness of using analytics over AI gameplay to measuring the impact to changes on video games. No relevant correlation was found between results inferred from AI testing and results from human testing.
