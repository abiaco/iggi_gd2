\subsection{Human testing methodology}

32 participants recruited through opportunity sampling (21 male and 11 female, 29 Right Handed, 2 Left-Handed, 1 ambidextrous, ages ranging between 15 to 61, with Mean = 38.66 and SD = +-13.55). All participants provided written consent prior to the experiment and were properly debriefed about the purposes of the experiment afterwards. No deception was involved. A google document questionnaire was created to record the participantsâ€™ responses. No sensitive information was asked and the data recorded was fully anonymised. Participants played one version of our game and they subsequently filled out questions regarding that specific version before moving on the next one. For counterbalancing purposes we created 6 subconditions (ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA) in order to account for possible order-fatigue effects. These procedures were created to reflect best practices in research design. However, due to the limited time for experimentation and the small number of participants, which leads to low power, no meaningful inferences could be made.
