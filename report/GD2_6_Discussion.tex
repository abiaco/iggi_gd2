The researchers acknowledge the limited generalizability of our results due to the small number of participants. Future studies should focus on the more detailed and precise measurement of participantsâ€™ game enjoyment which was beyond the scope of this paper.

This study does show that automated AI methods and analytics can be very helpful to assessing, at least at a broad level, how good, or bad, a game mode can be. By immediately discarding, without requiring human input, all the bad variations of a game, designers can focus on tweaking the ones automated testing deem as good. This is far from a completely tapped out research area, as digitizing the human factor is not a solved task.

For future studies, a more exploratory approach should be taken, with multiple human trials testing various different game design spaces. Most importantly, the selected test sample should contain a more varied selection of people, with a higher percentage of people with gaming experience.
